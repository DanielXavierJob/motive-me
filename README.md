## This website is a open source

Here I was with nothing to do so I decided to make a website that shows motivational phrases, and that has the possibility to add more messages from the community. If you liked it, leave a star on the project, it will help me a lot.

Also find out about other projects I have by going to my readme.md


## How to clone?

To clone this project you will need to have access to the google development api private keys and have two excel spreadsheets that have the necessary columns. I think it's good that if you're going to make a clone, leave the credits for me
